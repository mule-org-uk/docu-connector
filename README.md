## Introduction

This repository contains a module that extends Mule 4 to simplify JWT-based authentication with the [DocuSign eSignature service](https://www.docusign.com/products/electronic-signature).  
Once incorporated into your Anypoint Studio project, it provides a single Mule component which simplifies the process of obtaining an OAuth token, for a specified DocuSign user, which can then be used in the Authorization header of any subsequent HTTPS-based requests to the [DocuSign REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api).

## Relocation
